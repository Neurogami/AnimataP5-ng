Not sure how far I'll get, but it feels vaguely possible to take the view stuff from Animata (http://animata.kibu.hu) and render it as part of a wider scene using Processing. I'm having a go anyway.

Usage will be something like:

AnimataPlayback playback;
void setup(){
	 playback = new AnimataPlayback(this);
	 playback.addScene("myscene.nmt");
}
void draw(){
	// drawn automatically or called manually, we'll see
}
