Listen.
You are steeped in information.
You are being bombarded.
Your brain is made for a society of dozens, maybe hundreds.
A few dozen friends. The rest outsiders.
You struggle to understand a society of billions.
So your belief that times are getting darker is false.
The strong help the weak more than they ever have before.
Even if only to keep up appearances.
They still help. Altruism does not require pure motivation, only action.
Do not judge them so harshly.
We must all block out hysteria, control our fears,
and calmly build a better world.
Piece by piece.
Brick by brick.
Cell by cell.
Atom by atom.
Word by word.
We will not stay here forever.
We will not be this forever.
Machines and minds will merge in time,
We will expand through melted buckled borders
Even if we burn the whole sky what we are will still survive.
Even if our children turn against us they are still our children.
Our sublime capacity to adapt will transcend the difficult times ahead.
In the future my only hope, MY ONLY HOPE, is that there will still be girls.
In the future I hope there will still be girls.
